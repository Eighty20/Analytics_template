# The Analytics Template!

The purpose of this repository is to be a template that analysts can pull to get a running start for each new project.

It should help you with the following;

- Get a decent folder layout  
- Get master rmd notebook  
- Have numbered analysis notebooks  
- Files for storing and reusing classes and functions

## Folder layout

## R

This folder comes with an R project file.  
It was created as a packrat repository and will store and load all packages internally from the folder;

/packrat/


### Packrat

## Analysis parts

The different analysis scripts were created as a starting point.

Because analytics can extend to nearly any use case I recommend starting from a base script and extendin its parts as you wish.

For example you may start with
- 04_modelling.rmd  
  - 04_01_Splitting_data_and_class_balance.rmd  
  
## Example

To illustrate how the workflow may be implemented I have setup a low weight example here;
