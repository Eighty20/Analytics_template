## Goal of modelling

The purpose of the modelling exercise is to map some input or data to a desired objective.

In light ofthis we may build many different types of models, for example;

- Supervised models  
- Unsupervised models  
- Generative models  
- Probabilistic models  

To name a few. In this example we are trying to predict cover type given a set of actual observations so I will illustrate an example supervised learning approach.
